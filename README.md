## Problem Statement

* Due to the pandemic and social distancing measures, we now live a good part of our lives virtually. For some, this may seem like a dream come true, but for students in grade school this is a major disruption in their lives. Before the pandemic, schools used to manage students’ routines through scheduled period bells and having students physically move to their next classroom. But with the transition to online classes, they lose this scheduled routine. 

* Now more than ever, it’s important for students to keep a schedule of their routines throughout their days because it’s very easy to get sidetracked and lose incentive for school without one. Research shows that routines and schedules are important for young students because it helps them feel comfortable and safe knowing what’s next in their day. It can also have benefits in reduced anxiety and an increase in positive well-being and cognitive function. 

* As important as it is to keep a schedule, it is also important to motivate students to engage in time management. Through research it has been shown that time management is a universal problem. Children develop their time management skills at a different pace. And for many, time management is still a trouble after adulthood. So how can we motivate students to engage and practice in time management at an early age?
